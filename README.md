### A webpage using **HTML**, **CSS** and **BEM Methodology**

Hi! My name is **Jaia** and I'm a UX/UI & Product Designer who loves Front End Development.

I built this webpage in the course of 3 and a half weeks. **Flexbox** was used for the overall layout. Logos are clickable and feature **CSS transforms** when hovering over them. All links feature **CSS transitions** when hovering over them. **CSS animations** were added to the geometric blue shapes and will go on an infinite loop. For the youtube videos **iframe** was used instead of the `<video>` tag.
**HTML** markup is semantic, CSS classes and root file are named and organized according to **BEM Methodology**.

### Next steps

* Making the webpage fully responsive and ready for smaller screens and mobile devices.
* Adding different fonts to give a little more personality and modern feel to the webpage.
* Adding different CSS animations and transforms so users can click and interact with the images, thus giving them a better experience with the webpage.
